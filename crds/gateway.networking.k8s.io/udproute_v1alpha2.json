Note that the referenced parent resource needs to\nallow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means\nthe Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and\nnamespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same\nnamespace for a \"producer\" route, or the mesh implementation must support\nand allow \"consumer\" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is\nnot applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to\ncreate a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the\nRoute.\n\nThere are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n* Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\nThis API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent\nresources.\n\nParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n* They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n  entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n  multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n  be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n* They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n  each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n  optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n  combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n  same object must also set `sectionName`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n  object must also set `port`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n  referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\nIt is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may\nbe collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may\nchoose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the\ncase, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be\nmerged.\n\nNote that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific\nrules.
