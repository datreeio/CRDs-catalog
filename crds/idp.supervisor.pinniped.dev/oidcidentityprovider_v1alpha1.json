By default, when this field is not set, the Supervisor will request\nthe following scopes: \"openid\", \"offline_access\", \"email\", and \"profile\". See\nhttps://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims for a description of the \"profile\" and \"email\"\nscopes. See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess for a description of the\n\"offline_access\" scope. This default value may change in future versions of Pinniped as the standard evolves,\nor as common patterns used by providers who implement the standard in the ecosystem evolve.\nBy setting this list to anything other than an empty list, you are overriding the\ndefault value, so you may wish to include some of \"offline_access\", \"email\", and \"profile\" in your override list.\nIf you do not want any of these scopes to be requested, you may set this list to contain only \"openid\".\nSome OIDC providers may also require a scope to get access to the user's group membership, in which case you\nmay wish to include it in this list. Sometimes the scope to request the user's group membership is called\n\"groups\", but unfortunately this is not specified in the OIDC standard.\nGenerally speaking, you should include any scopes required to cause the appropriate claims to be the returned by\nyour OIDC provider in the ID token or userinfo endpoint results for those claims which you would like to use in\nthe oidcClaims settings to determine the usernames and group memberships of your Kubernetes users. See\nyour OIDC provider's documentation for more information about what scopes are available to request claims.\nAdditionally, the Pinniped Supervisor requires that your OIDC provider returns refresh tokens to the Supervisor\nfrom these authorization flows. For most OIDC providers, the scope required to receive refresh tokens will be\n\"offline_access\". See the documentation of your OIDC provider's authorization and token endpoints for its\nrequirements for what to include in the request in order to receive a refresh token in the response, if anything.\nNote that it may be safe to send \"offline_access\" even to providers which do not require it, since the provider\nmay ignore scopes that it does not understand or require (see\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.3). In the unusual case that you must avoid sending the\n\"offline_access\" scope, then you must override the default value of this setting. This is required if your OIDC\nprovider will reject the request when it includes \"offline_access\" (e.g. GitLab's OIDC provider).",
