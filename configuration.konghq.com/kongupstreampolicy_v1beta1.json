  "description": "KongUpstreamPolicy allows configuring algorithm that should be used for load balancing traffic between Kong\nUpstream's Targets. It also allows configuring health checks for Kong Upstream's Targets.\n\nIts configuration is similar to Kong Upstream object (https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/admin-api/#upstream-object),\nand it is applied to Kong Upstream objects created by the controller.\n\nIt can be attached to Services. To attach it to a Service, it has to be annotated with\n`konghq.com/upstream-policy: <name>`, where `<name>` is the name of the KongUpstreamPolicy\nobject in the same namespace as the Service.\n\nWhen attached to a Service, it will affect all Kong Upstreams created for the Service.\n\nWhen attached to a Service used in a Gateway API *Route rule with multiple BackendRefs, all of its Services MUST\nbe configured with the same KongUpstreamPolicy. Otherwise, the controller will *ignore* the KongUpstreamPolicy.\n\nNote: KongUpstreamPolicy doesn't implement Gateway API's GEP-713 strictly.\nIn particular, it doesn't use the TargetRef for attaching to Services and Gateway API *Routes - annotations are\nused instead. This is to allow reusing the same KongUpstreamPolicy for multiple Services and Gateway API *Routes.",
