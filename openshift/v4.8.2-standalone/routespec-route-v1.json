  "description": "RouteSpec describes the hostname or path the route exposes, any security information, and one to four backends (services) the route points to. Requests are distributed among the backends depending on the weights assigned to each backend. When using roundrobin scheduling the portion of requests that go to each backend is the backend weight divided by the sum of all of the backend weights. When the backend has more than one endpoint the requests that end up on the backend are roundrobin distributed among the endpoints. Weights are between 0 and 256 with default 100. Weight 0 causes no requests to the backend. If all weights are zero the route will be considered to have no backends and return a standard 503 response.\n\nThe `tls` field is optional and allows specific certificates or behavior for the route. Routers typically configure a default certificate on a wildcard domain to terminate routes without explicit certificates, but custom hostnames usually must choose passthrough (send traffic directly to the backend via the TLS Server-Name- Indication field) or provide a certificate.",
