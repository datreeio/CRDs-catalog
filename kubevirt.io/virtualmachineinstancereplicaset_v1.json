                  "description": "EvictionStrategy describes the strategy to follow when a node drain occurs.\nThe possible options are:\n- \"None\": No action will be taken, according to the specified 'RunStrategy' the VirtualMachine will be restarted or shutdown.\n- \"LiveMigrate\": the VirtualMachineInstance will be migrated instead of being shutdown.\n- \"LiveMigrateIfPossible\": the same as \"LiveMigrate\" but only if the VirtualMachine is Live-Migratable, otherwise it will behave as \"None\".\n- \"External\": the VirtualMachineInstance will be protected and 'vmi.Status.EvacuationNodeName' will be set on eviction. This is mainly useful for cluster-api-provider-kubevirt (capk) which needs a way for VMI's to be blocked from eviction, yet signal capk that eviction has been called on the VMI so the capk controller can handle tearing the VMI down.
