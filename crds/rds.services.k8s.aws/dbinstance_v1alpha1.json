Don't specify PreSignedUrl when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region. \n The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values: \n - DestinationRegion - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region. \n - KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL. \n - SourceDBInstanceIdentifier - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115. \n To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). \n If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region. \n SourceRegion isn't supported for SQL Server, because Amazon RDS for SQL Server doesn't support cross-Region read replicas. \n This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.",
