For example, given:\n  {\n    Addresses: [{\"ip\": \"10.10.1.1\"}, {\"ip\": \"10.10.2.2\"}],\n    Ports:     [{\"name\": \"a\", \"port\": 8675}, {\"name\": \"b\", \"port\": 309}]\n  }\nThe resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:\n    a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],\n    b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]",
