A path element refers is the list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz). * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types. Implementations are required to support all path types.",
