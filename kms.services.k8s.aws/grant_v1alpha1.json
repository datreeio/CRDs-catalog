Grants with grant constraints can include the DescribeKey and RetireGrant operations, but the constraint doesn't apply to these operations. If a grant with a grant constraint includes the CreateGrant operation, the constraint requires that any grants created with the CreateGrant permission have an equally strict or stricter encryption context constraint. \n You cannot use an encryption context grant constraint for cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys.
