ReferenceGrants allowing\na reference from a Route to a Service are only applicable to BackendRefs.\n\n\nReferenceGrant is a form of runtime verification allowing users to assert\nwhich cross-namespace object references are permitted. Implementations that\nsupport ReferenceGrant MUST NOT permit cross-namespace references which have\nno grant, and MUST respond to the removal of a grant by revoking the access\nthat the grant allowed.",
