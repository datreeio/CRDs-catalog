Each Pod completion is homologous to each other.\n\n`Indexed` means that the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1), available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index. The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. When value is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and `.spec.parallelism` must be less than or equal to 10^5.\n\nThis field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the IndexedJob feature gate. More completion modes can be added in the future. If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, the controller skips updates for the Job.",
