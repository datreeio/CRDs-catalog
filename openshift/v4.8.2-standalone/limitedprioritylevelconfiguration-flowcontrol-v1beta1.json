ACS must be a positive number. The server's concurrency limit (SCL) is divided among the concurrency-controlled priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares. This produces the assured concurrency value (ACV) --- the number of requests that may be executing at a time --- for each such priority level:\n\n            ACV(l) = ceil( SCL * ACS(l) / ( sum[priority levels k] ACS(k) ) )\n\nbigger numbers of ACS mean more reserved concurrent requests (at the expense of every other PL).
