This means perspective running\npods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.\nHealthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.\n\nAdditional policies may be added in the future.\nClients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods\nif they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.",
